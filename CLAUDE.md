## When a change is complete

run ./scripts/check.sh and fix until green

## Commit Style

**Do NOT auto-commit changes.** Always show the user what changes have been made and let them review before committing.

When the user requests a commit:
- Use concise, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format: `type: subject`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`
- Keep subject line under 80 characters
- **NEVER** include marketing language, promotional text, or AI attribution
- **NEVER** add "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
